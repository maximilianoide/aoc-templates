Made for personal use only, it may or it may not be an abomination


I wanted to do Advent of Code challenges in order, but instead I ended up making a small script to generate my folders for each year/day with input scraping from AoC using your cookie key.
It also automatically start a git repo on the main folder of the language you selected, so you can store all your solutions in a language in a single repo.
For now it only generates ruby boilerplate, more languages coming soon (or never, I have 10 years of AoC to catch up to)

### Usage
- Have Ruby installed
- `rake setup_aoc`
- Select language, year you want to do and enteder your AoC cookie (it gets stored locally on a hidden file at the root folder)
- Enjoy! (or procastinate and never do them)
